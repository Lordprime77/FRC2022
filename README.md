# FRC2022

This is the code for the RoboRIO going in the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition Rapid React.

## Requirements

I (br-ccps) set this up on a Debian 11 Linux x86-64 machine, same instructions can be applied to systems running Windows or MacOS (not sure about FreeBSD). This should work on other CPU archs such as ARM64 (RPi 4, RK3399, etc.). 

This project uses the RobotPy library, instructions on installing the library on the host PC and the RoboRIO can be found here:
